# Trojan-Simulator

This educational tool, Trojan Simulator, offers a hands-on way to learn about Trojan horse operations.  Through a user-friendly interface, the simulator demonstrates  "malicious" activities in a controlled environment, without any destructive consequences.  The application uses a calculator-style display. To be clear, this simulator is entirely safe; it employs only simulated, non-harmful file operations and contains no genuine malicious code.
